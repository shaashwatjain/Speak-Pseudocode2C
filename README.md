# Speak Pseudocode2c: A framework to convert customized pseudocode to c code

The source code of certain languages can be tough to understand for beginners and might make them lose interest in the subject altogether. Instead, the pseudocode is simpler compared to source code, as it abstracts away the peculiarities of programming language. The solution proposed in this paper is a framework, Speak Pseudocode2c, that addresses the simplicity of using natural language pseudocode, spoken line-by-line by the user which is simultaneously converted into source code in c language using a static stub-based approach. This approach is designed on programming constructs for different types of statements and loops, triggered by the user speaking an action word i.e. the first word present in the speech, which otherwise is counted as narration and is commented. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) gives this approach the flexibility to interpret the pseudocode robustly.
