1) Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
2) Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17
3) Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.
4) Write a program that prints a multiplication table for a number.
5) Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the 6) largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)
7) Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.
8) Write a program divisor.c which calculates the smallest divisor of a number.
